# ARTI-308-Machine-Learning-Labs
This repository is part of the **ARTI 308: Machine Learning** course.

Hi! I'm **Haya**, an Artificial Intelligence student with a strong interest in Machine Learning and its real-world applications.  
I enjoy breaking down complex concepts into clear practical ideas and continuously exploring how data and models can be used to solve meaningful problems.

This repository will be used throughout the course to document:
- Machine Learning labs and assignments  
- Hands-on experiments with ML models  

Beyond the course, this repository reflects my personal learning journey and my interest in sharing knowledge in a simple and practical way through clearer explanations, practical examples, and educational content.

**Note:** Explanations and learning guides for these labs are provided through a dedicated YouTube playlist hosted on my personal channel:
